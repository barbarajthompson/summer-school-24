# Kamodo


Kamodo is an official NASA open-source project written in Python. 
It is developed and maintained by the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC). 


Kamodo is a software tool for access, interpolation, and visualization of space weather models and data. 
It allows scientists to represent simulation results as mathematical functions.


Kamodo is a core package in the Python in Heliophysics Community (PyHC), which promotes development, 
collaboration, and standards for the solar and space physics community.


Kamodo supports novice users through a simplified web interface as well as advanced users with sophisticated notebooks or command line scripting.
